                <h2>Extracurricular Activities</h2>
                <p class="p8">
                    One of the things I usually like to do is volunteering.
                </p>
                <p class="p8">
                    In my last year of highschool, I took up volunteering at Nehemyia Autistic Center and it was 
                    really fulfiling. It's a school for autistic children at a nursery level. 
                    It was pretty clear not a lot of people knew about it because they were clearly understaffed
                    and in need of helpful volunteers.
                </p>

                <p class="p8">
                    There’s also another volunteer society called Care for Epilepsy which focuses on the condition epilepsy 
                    and how to create awareness about it. It was worth joining it since it helped bring a lot perspective 
                    about how dangerous epilepsy can be. I encourage people to check it out.
                </p>

                <h2>Some Inspiration</h2>
                <p class="p9">
                    There are many people in the world that have truly amazing and inspiring stories. One that stuck with me is that of 
                    Malala Yousafzai's.
                </p>
                <p class="p9">
                    I read her book around the time where I was in middle school and it's safe to say that I was 
                    completely awed by her. Malala Yousafzai is a girl who refused to be denied the right to education
                    by the Taliban, the people who were taking over her homeland Pakistan. 
                </p>

                <p class="p9">
                    She became an advocate for girl's
                    education when she was a child herself. Not only did she get shot in the head by a Taliban gunsman and survived,
                    she was also the youngest person to receive a Nobel Peace Prize.
                   
                </p>

                <p class="p9">
                    She's an amazing example for people who want to fight for what they believe in and make the world 
                    a better place. I think people can learn a lot from her and I strongly encourage reading her book.
